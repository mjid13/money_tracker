# Images Directory

This directory is for storing image assets used in the Money Tracker application.

## Usage Guidelines

- Place all application images in this directory
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the purpose of the image
- Consider organizing images into subdirectories if the number of images grows large
- Prefer SVG format for icons and logos when possible for better scaling
- Optimize image sizes for web use to improve page load times

## Examples

- Logo images: logo.png, logo-dark.png
- UI icons: icon-dashboard.svg, icon-transaction.svg
- Background images: bg-pattern.jpg, header-bg.jpg

## Recommended Image Formats

- SVG: For icons, logos, and simple graphics that need to scale
- PNG: For images that require transparency
- JPG/JPEG: For photographs and complex images without transparency
- WebP: For modern browsers with better compression
